# Tin Roof Audition Three

This is my response to a problem posed by a interviewer from Tin Roof Software.

== This is the problem prompt ==

Using React, Angular, or a Javascript framework of your choice, created a frontend application that allows for displaying photo albums for multiple users using the data located at the /users, /photos, and /albums APIs located at http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com
 
1. The application should display a list of users
2. Selecting a user should display a list of photo albums for that user
3. The list of albums should show a thumbnail of the album, which is just the first photo's thumbnail.
4. Clicking on an album should show the entire list of photos in the album, using each photo's thumbnail.
5. Clicking on a photo should show the full size photo with the photo's title as a caption.
6. The application should support asynchronous pagination of albums and photos. 
 
Spend at least an hour but no more than one and a half hours to complete as much of this as you can. When finished post on github and send us a link, or zip your code and send it via email.
